## Becoming a Lantern
The first step to becoming a lantern, is to get a Blank Lantern Ring
To make a Blank Ring, you need to make a Ring Core.  
A Ring Core is made up of 8 Emotional Shards and a Diamond Block.  
Emotional Shards can be found inside Emotional Shard Ore

After obtaining a Blank Ring, you must achieve the required Karma level for your selected color

Black/Death | -100
Red/Rage | -75
Yellow/Fear | -50
Orange/Greed | -25
Blue/Hope | 0
Green/Will | 25
Indigo/Compassion | 50
Pink/Love | 75

After obtaining the proper karma level for your lantern corps, right click the Blank Ring to recieve your Lantern ring
You can use the /addKarma command to add or subrtact karma, and use /karma or the karma keybind (*k* by default) to view your current karma
You can only have one lantern ring at a time, but can use the command /reset to gain another
After obtaining your Lantern Corps ring, simply put it in your off hand, and all of your abilities will activate
